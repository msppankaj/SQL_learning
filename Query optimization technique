it is defined as the use of sql query in best posisble way to enahnce the performace of query and to get the result quicky and best possible way i,e instantly.
there is some method and way to enhance the performance of query result. we are discussing one-one.
1-indexing-- index is a method
there are two type of index, clustered and non clusdted index.clustered physically sort data while non clusterd create separate page to index.
sytax:
select price,country,price from ['winemag-data_first150k$'] order by Serial_num offset 100 rows fetch next 20 rows only
select * from ['winemag-data_first150k$'] order by country
create clustered index xxx on ['winemag-data_first150k$'](Serial_num)

select * from sys.indexes where name=nnn
select * from sys.objects

create index nnn on ['winemag-data_first150k$'](points,price,country)-- non clustered index
select country,points from ['winemag-data_first150k$']

select object_name(object_id) as tablename, * 
from sys.indexes where type_desc = 'NONCLUSTERED' and name='nnn'

drop index xxx on ['winemag-data_first150k$']
2- select:

do not user select * from ccc, try to find selected columns and rows that is needed.
select * from ccc-- dnt user
select cc, yy, from xx where cc='uuu'--user like this.

3-select country from ['winemag-data_first150k$'] where exists (select price from ['winemag-data_first150k$'] where price=5)
use exists to find, if available the get record else not
4- use join insted of subquery
5- use of wildcard wisely.
dnt use like '%ddd%
use 'dddf%'
