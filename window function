inset into wind_func_sql values('pankaj',102,'rachi',10000)

--ranking winddow function:
ROW_NUMBER()
RANK()
DENSE_RANK()
NTILE()
PERCENT_RANK()
select * from wind_func
select *,rank() over (order by city) as rrr from wind_func
select *,dense_rank() over (order by city) as rrr from wind_func
select *,row_number() over (order by particular) as rrr from wind_func
select *,ntile(3) over (order by p_id) as rrr from wind_func

select * from wind_func
select *,rank() over (partition by p_id order by city) as rrr from wind_func
select *,dense_rank() over ( partition by p_id order by city) as rrr from wind_func
select *,row_number() over (partition by p_id order by particular) as rrr from wind_func

--SQL Server used this function to get the first, last, previous, and next values in a table. It mainly contains these functions: LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), and LAST_VALUE().
--value wind_function:
select *,lead(city,1) over (partition by p_id order by city) from wind_func
select *,lead(city,1) over (order by city) from wind_func

select *,lag(city,2) over (partition by p_id order by city) from wind_func
select *,lag(city,2) over (order by city) from wind_func

select *,first_value(city) over (partition by p_id order by city) from wind_func
select *,first_value(city) over (order by city) from wind_func

select *,last_value(s_amount) over (partition by p_id order by city) from wind_func
select *,last_value(city) over (order by city) from wind_func
