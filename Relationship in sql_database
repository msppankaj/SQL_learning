-relationship is a establishing assoaciation betweeen two or more table in sql dbms.it is based on common field between more than one tables and involve primary key and foreign key.
-there are five types of relationship in dbms names, one to one,one to many, many to one, many to one and self referencing.
-one to one- here first table has pk that is uique and not null. and second columns is related to first column and has one record ony.

1 to 1 relationship.
create table relation(name varchar(25),id int primary key)
create table relation1(empid int primary key,city varchar(22))
insert into relation values ('pankaj',1),('pankaj',2),('pankaj',3)
insert into relation1 values (1,'pankaj'),(2,'pankaj'),(3,'pankaj')
select * from relation
select * from relation1
 in this query created two table with pk and pk columns will not accept duplicate value on any table that maintain one to one ralatioship.

1 to many:
below queries is a type of normalization of 1 to many, here we will have created two tables, 1st table with pk in id and 2nd table empid is with fk that reference pk in first table.

create table relation(name varchar(25),id int primary key)
create table relation1(empid int foreign key references relation(id),city varchar(22))
insert into relation values ('pankaj',1),('pankaj',2),('pankaj',3)
insert into relation1 values (1,'pankaj'),(2,'pankaj'),(3,'pankaj'),(2,'pankaj'),(3,'pankaj')
select * from relation
select * from relation1

many to one: is also same kind of one to many types and but the difference is only one where one table consider as 2nd and 2nd consider as 1st.

many to many: 

here theer is concept where column of one table has many values and that reference to other table columns has also same vice versa.
create table relation(name varchar(25),id int primary key)
create table relation1(empid int ,city varchar(22) primary key)
create table fk1(reid int foreign key references relation(id),addr varchar(22) foreign key references relation1(city))
insert into relation values ('pankaj',1),('pankaj',2),('pankaj',3)
insert into relation1 values (1,'nnd'),(2,'del'),(3,'ggn')
select * from relation
select * from relation1
insert into fk1 values (1,'nnd'),(3,'del'),(3,'ggn'),(1,'nnd'),(2,'del'),(3,'ggn')
