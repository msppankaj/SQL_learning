ACID Property in sql.
Atomicity: this property explain that all transactio should complete fully or nothing.e.g, in one trasacion doing 2 query, update and insert, it means both update and insert done sucessfuly 
else cancel both. not insret done or update fail and vice versa.
consistancy:. Consistency guarantees that changes made within a transaction are populated across the database system (e.g., nodes) and in alignment with DBMS constraints. 
If data consistency is going to be negatively impacted by a transaction in an inconsistent state, the entire transaction will fail. eg A has 100 and B has 200 doing trans as a pass 50 to B then
the total before tran is 300 and after tran 300 then trasn is sucess.
isolation:Isolation guarantees that each transaction appears to execute independently, even when multiple transactions are running concurrently. 
This means that changes made by one transaction are not visible to other transactions until the first transaction is committed
durability:Durability ensures that once a transaction is successfully completed (committed), the changes made by that transaction are permanently recorded and will not be lost, 
even if the system crashes or experiences a power outage
